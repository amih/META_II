1. cd to the project folder
2. http-server                            # will serve the index.html page from http://localhost:8080
3. Select 'ia15. meta_ii with loops, use with ca05' from the first list on the left
4. Select 'ca05 added STORE AND LOAD VARIABLES' from the center list
5. click the ⤺ arrow to copy the output to the center text area
6. Select 'ia16. sql to eosio' which will output the compiler
7. click the ⤺ arrow to copy the output to the center text area
8. Select 'ia17. create table example' to see the sql2eos compiler in action!

TODO:

 V get rid of while loops that test each character, use regex instead.
 * convert stack frames to structured objects
 * write meta compiler with new version
 * self contained output javascript meta_ii with interpreter
